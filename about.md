### Hi there.

I love building things (mostly for the web) and celebrating the joy of programming. In my free time I enjoy trying out new programming languages. This weblog is an outlet for me to share my learnings.

If you'd like to connect, feel free to reach out on my [email](mailto:evansj@email.chop.edu)
