### Hi there.

I love building things (mostly for the web) and celebrating the joy of programming. In my free time I enjoy gaming[^1], [doing courses](https://www.coursera.org/user/i/e4186f8a5a1d905570f125f4170056e0) and trying out new programming languages. This weblog is an outlet for me to share my learnings while I wander through the depths of the tech-world.

If you'd like to connect, feel free to reach out on my [email](mailto:prakhar1989@gmail.com)
