When Joe Armstrong, the creator of Erlang, [writes a post](http://joearms.github.io/2014/02/07/why-programming-is-difficult.html) on "Programming is Hard" you cant help but say to yourself - You're not alone!

> If you’ve got this far, you’ll understand that I think programming is pretty damn difficult. That’s why workplaces are designed to make programming even more difficult. We have open plan offices which provide a noisy environment to break our concentration, mobile phones to disturb us, and internet to distract us.

On the other hand, one cant help but wonder at the power we, programmers, have - power to automate mundane tasks, solve hard problems and hopefully to change the world. 

P.S: To generate this new post, I hacked up a quick [Rakefile](https://github.com/prakhar1989/prakhar1989.github.com/blob/master/Rakefile) to create a new post and dev environment for me. Yay for automation (& laziness)!
