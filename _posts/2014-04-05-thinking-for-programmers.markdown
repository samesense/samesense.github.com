Leslie Lamport, the creator the famous Paxos' Algorithm and LaTeX, in his paper talks about what programmers are doing wrong?

Answer: Not thinking enough

<blockquote>
For quite a while, I’ve been disturbed by the emphasis on language in computer science. One result of that emphasis is programmers who are C++ experts but can’t write programs that do what they’re supposed to. The typical computer science response is that programmers need to use the right programming/specification/development language instead of/in addition to C++. The typical industrial response is to provide the programmer with better debugging tools, on the theory that we can obtain good programs by putting a monkey at a keyboard and automatically finding the errors in its code.
